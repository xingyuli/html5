For improving the readability of my toy code. I use comment annotation in html
page. Here is a berief instruction of all the comment annotations.

They are:

@date		On what date I tested the code block.

@browser	With what browsers I've tested.

@notwork	Browsers that didn't work among my tested @browser.
			If this annotation is not present, it means all tested browsers work properly.

@comment	Additional comments about things that have not that much relationship with the HTML5 feature.
